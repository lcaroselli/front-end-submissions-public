# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/lcaroselli/Poke150-api/blob/master/server.js#L67)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
It took me a little bit to understand query parameters and how to implement them, so I was proud of myself when I finally understood how to add a query parameter to an end point. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/lcaroselli/Poke150-api/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L192)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
I kept getting a 500 error whenever I tried to test the response I got back in my tests. I asked for help from several people, but we couldn't quite figure out what was going on.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

This project was a lot to do alone, but it forced me to really solidify all the concepts we learned to this point, and I appreciate that. I feel like I could have gotten more accomplished more quickly with a project partner, or if I had been able to join another group.

I notified Robbie about my circlCI build failing on deployment to Heroku, but neither of us could figure out what was going on. The build was successful to a point and keeps giving me an error about the tip of the branch not being up to date, even though it is.
